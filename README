SsoWhat
=======

Sso What is used to generate a session domain for single sign-on which works regardless of subdomains and different hosts in different environments. So. If you have two servers, 'kill.for.thrills.hypo.luxa' and 'thrill.olympics.hypo.luxa', the session domain would resolve to 'hypo.luxa'.  

If your staging environment uses 'kill.for.thrills.alien.jourgensen' it will automatically use 'alien.jourgensen' without further configuration. 

To enable this feature set the session options on ActionController using the following line in your environment file:

config.action_controller.session = {:session_domain  => :base_host}

Shoulda and Mocha are required to run the tests.
